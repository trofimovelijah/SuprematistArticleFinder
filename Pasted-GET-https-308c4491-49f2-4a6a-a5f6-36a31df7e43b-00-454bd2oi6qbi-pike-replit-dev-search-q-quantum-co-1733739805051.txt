      "snippet": "Algorithms that require many different pairs of qubits to interact, such as in quantum volume circuits\u00a0[47], therefore only marginally benefit from distributing quantum computations. Specifically for data DQC, this means that algorithms in which the data stored at different quantum computers needs to be communicated between different parties a significant amount of times, are unsuitable for DQC. In DQC, each quantum device uses two types of qubits: Computation qubits used to perform the quantum algorithm; and, communication qubits used to communicate with other quantum devices. Distributed quantum computing does introduce an additional overhead, both in the number of required qubits, as well as in the communication between different devices. J.
